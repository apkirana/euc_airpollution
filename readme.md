# Agentic AI for AQI Forecasting (euc_airpollution)

**Note:** This repository contains the prototype and supporting materials for a submission to the **European Universities' Competition on Artificial Intelligence** in the "AI and Climate Change Solutions" category.

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a novel **agentic AI system** designed to deliver a fully autonomous workflow for Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting. Focused on the JABODETABEK (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi) megaregion in Indonesiaâ€”an area facing a severe and persistent air quality crisisâ€”our system provides an end-to-end solution for data integration, analysis, and the generation of explainable insights.

The core of this project is a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to manage the entire modeling lifecycle, from real-time data acquisition to the delivery of actionable reports for policymakers. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional, static forecasting models by introducing adaptability, transparency, and scalability.

## 2. Key Features

- **Autonomous Multi-Agent System:** The workflow is driven by a team of specialized agents (Orchestrator, Data Collection, Preprocessing, ML Operations, and Reporting) that manage tasks without manual intervention.
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** The system automates the entire data pipeline, including sourcing data from diverse APIs (GEE, IQAir), cleaning and validation, and preprocessing for time-series analysis.
- **Accurate Time-Series Forecasting:** A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is used to generate high-accuracy AQI forecasts, capturing complex temporal patterns in pollution data.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) Reporting:** A dedicated Explanation Agent uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate complex quantitative forecasts into clear, natural language summaries, making the results accessible to non-expert stakeholders.

## 3. System Architecture

The system is designed with a modular, server-hosted core that separates responsibilities into distinct agent layers. The **Orchestrator Agent** acts as the central controller, receiving user requests and delegating tasks to the appropriate agents.

- **Data Pipeline Agents:** Handle the acquisition and preparation of data.
- **ML Operations Agents:** Manage the loading of the LSTM model and the execution of the forecast.
- **Reporting Layer:** Focuses on converting the model's output into human-readable reports and visualizations.

## 4. Web Dashboard Prototype

To demonstrate the system's capabilities, we have designed an interactive web interface. The prototype includes a landing page introducing the project and a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing the forecasts.

**Key features of the dashboard include:**

- An interactive heatmap of the JABODETABEK region.
- An **"Ask the AI"** feature that allows users to submit natural language queries for custom forecasts (e.g., "What is the forecast for the Bekasi industrial area tomorrow?").
- A **"Live Agent Status"** panel that visualizes the autonomous workflow in real-time, showing which agents are active as they work to fulfill a user's request.
